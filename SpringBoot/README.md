## Starting new service on SpringBoot

## What is Spring Framework?

Java Spring Framework (Spring Framework) is a popular, open source, enterprise-level framework for creating standalone, production-grade applications that run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java Spring Boot (Spring Boot) is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with Spring Framework faster and easier through three core capabilities:
1. Autoconfiguration
2. An opinionated approach to configuration
3. The ability to create standalone applications

## Why Spring Framework?

Spring Framework offers a dependency injection feature that lets objects define their own dependencies that the Spring container later injects into them.This enables developers to create modular applications consisting of loosely coupled components that are ideal for microservices and distributed network applications.

## Why SpringBoot?

As capable and comprehensive as Spring Framework is, it still requires significant time and knowledge to configure, set up, and deploy Spring applications. Spring Boot mitigates this effort with three important capabilities.
