## Transparent proxy

Transparent proxy allows users to reach other services in the service mesh while ensuring that inbound and outbound traffic for services in the mesh are directed through the sidecar proxy. 
Traffic is secured and only reaches intended destinations since the proxy can enforce security and policy like TLS and Service Intentions.
